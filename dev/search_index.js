By default, the name is run_<number> where <number> is the number in the order.\nThe type key determines the target orbital shapes to reconstruct. By default, it accepts atomic orbital designations (s, px, py, pz, dx2y2 or dx2-y2, dz2, dxy,  dxz, and dyz), or hybrid designations ( sp, which includes p-orbitals with any directionality, or user-defined linear combinations of atomic orbitals with lcao) . These designations are not case-sensitive.\nsite_file is only used for sp cage and lcao runs. The input is an XYZ file (Cartesian coordinates in angstroms).\nsites can accept multiple arguments. By default, this is all, which runs the whole list of atoms. However, this can be limited if desired: the atom names from the POSCAR can be included, and can be postpended with lists of individual sites or ranges of sites.\nThe radius is only relevant for sp hybrids, and it is the length (in angstroms) used to search for atoms that contribute to that hybrid.\nrsphere is the radius for the Psphere metric.","category":"page"},{"location":"usage.html#LCAO-sites-file","page":"Usage","title":"LCAO sites file","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"usage.html","page":"Usage","title":"Usage","text":"Here is an example YAML file for user-defined linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).","category":"page"},{"location":"usage.html","page":"Usage","title":"Usage","text":"target:\n  - px: -1\n    py: 1\nlcao:\n  - [1]\n  - [2]\n  - [17]\n  - [18]\n  - [33]\n  - [34]\n  - [49]\n  - [50]\n  - [65]\n  - [66]\n  - [81]\n  - [82]\n  - [97]\n  - [98]\n  - [113]\n  - [114]","category":"page"},{"location":"usage.html","page":"Usage","title":"Usage","text":"Here are some of the important components of this example file:","category":"page"},{"location":"usage.html","page":"Usage","title":"Usage","text":"The target: key indicates that a list of LCAOs will follow.
